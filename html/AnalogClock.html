    // The function will calculate the difference in weeks between the first thursday of the year (always week #1) and the thursday in the target week. To do this it will first create a new date object called target and change it so it points at the thursday in the target week. The millisecond value of that date object is then stored. Next, the first thursday of the year is found and the difference in weeks between these two thursdays, plus one, is returned. Because of the ceil any daylight saving differences are ignored.

    var target  = new Date(this.valueOf());

    // ISO 8601 states that week 1 is the week with the first thursday of that year.
